    :param h: a Signomial or Polynomial (with only scalars as coefficients)
    :param L: a Signomial or Polynomial (likely with coniclifts Variables as coefficients)

    Assumptions:

        The rows of lagrangian.alpha must include all rows of (s_h * h).alpha.
        s_h, h, and lagrangian are all of the same type (i.e. all Signomials, or all Polynomials).

    Primary Usage:

        A constraint "h(x) == 0" or "h(x) >= 0" appears in an optimization problem. That constraint
        has been incorporated into a Lagrangian "L", with an associated Lagrange muliplier "s_h".

        Let w(x) = s_h(x) * h(x), and let F be the nonlinear map (consisting entrywise of signomials,
        or polynomials) satisfying w(x) = s_h.c @ F(x). Such a map certainly exists, although its
        entries may include complicated functions with multiple terms (i.e. not just monomials).

        Let G be either G(x) = x^L.alpha (if L is a Polynomial) or G(x) = exp(L.alpha @ x)
        (if L is a Signomial), so that L(x) = L.c @ G(x).

        Since w.alpha is a subset of L.alpha, there exists a matrix C so that F(x) == C @ G(x),
        and in turn so that w(x) == s_h.c @ (C @ G(x)).

        This function returns that matrix C, for use in constructing dual SAGE relaxations.

        The specific usage of C is as follows. Suppose that "v" is the dual variable to the constraint
        that "lagrangian is SAGE". If s_h was a SAGE function, the dual problem will include
        a constraint of the form "C @ v is in the dual SAGE cone over exponents s_h.alpha".
        If s_h was unconstrained, then the dual problem will include a constraint "C @ v == 0".

    Secondary usage:

        We want to minimize the function s_h over some X \\subset \\R^n.
        The function "h" is fixed, and is known to be positive almost-everywhere on X.
        s_h and h are related to L by the identity L == s_h * h.

        Returns a matrix "C" that maps outer-approximations of the moment-cone for functions
        "like" L (i.e. Polynomials or Signomials over exponents L.alpha) to outer-approximations
        of the moment-cone for functions "like" s_h (Polynomials or Signomials over exponents
        s_h.alpha).
