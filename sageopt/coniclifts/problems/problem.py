class Problem(object):
    """
    A representation for a convex optimization problem. When this Problem object is constructed,
    the constraints are immediately compiled into a flattened conic representation. This compilation
    process may take some time for large problems.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sense : str
        Either ``coniclifts.MIN`` or ``coniclifts.MAX``

    objective : Expression
        The function to minimize or maximize. ScalarExpressions and real numeric types
        are also accepted. The final (cast) expression must be linear in its Variables.

    constraints : list of coniclifts.Constraint
        Variables appearing in ``objective`` are subject to Constraint objects in this list.

    Attributes
    ----------
    sense: str

        The value passed by the user to the constructor.

    objective : Expression

        The value passed by the user to the constructor.

    constraints : list of coniclifts.Constraint

        The value passed by the user to the constructor.

    all_variables : list of coniclifts.Variable

        All Variable objects needed to represent the feasible set. This includes user-declared
        Variables, and Variables which were required to write the problem in terms of coniclifts
        primitives. It is recommended to access this list by calling ``self.variables()``.

    status : str

        The problem status from the last call to ``self.solve``.
        Either ``coniclifts.SOLVED`` or ``coniclifts.INACCURATE`` or ``coniclifts.FAILED``.

    value : float

        The objective value from the last call to ``self.solve``. Can be a float,
         ``np.inf``, ``-np.inf``, or ``np.NaN``.

    variable_values : Dict[str, ndarray]

        A map from a Variable's ``name`` field to a numpy array, containing a feasible
        value for that Variable for this problem's constraints.

    metadata : dict

        A place for users to store metadata produced when constructing this Problem.

    timings : dict

        Contains runtime (in seconds) for various operations associated with Problem.
        There is always a field ``timings['compile_time']``, which is the time spent parsing
        user-specified constraints into a vectorized cone program. Upon a call to
        ``self.solve(solver=SOLVER)``, there is also a dict ``timings[SOLVER]`` which contains
        time spent transforming a coniclifts representation to a solver's standard form, and
        time spent by the underlying solver itself.

    solver_apply_data : Dict[str,dict]

        Stores metadata during a call to ``self.solve(cache_apply_data=True)``.

    solver_raw_output : Dict[str,dict]

        Stores metadata during a call to ``self.solve(cache_raw_output=True)``.

    A : CSC-format sparse matrix

        The matrix in the flattened conic representation of the feasible set.

    b : ndarray

        The offset vector in the flattened conic representation of the feasible set.

    K : list of coniclifts.Cone

        The cartesian product of these cones (in order) defines the convex cone appearing
        in the flattened conic representation of the feasible set.

    variable_map : Dict[str,ndarray]

        A map from a Variable's ``name`` field to a numpy array. If ``myvar`` is a
        coniclifts Variable appearing in the system defined by ``constraints``, then
        a point ``x`` satisfying :math:`A x + b \\in K` maps to a feasible value for
        ``myvar`` by ::

            x0 = np.hstack([x, 0])
            myvar_val = x0[variable_map[myvar.name]]

        In particular, we guarantee ``myvar.shape == variable_map[myvar.name].shape``.
        Augmenting ``x`` by zero to create ``x0`` reflects a convention that if a component of
        a Variable does not affect the constraints, that component is automatically assigned
        the value zero.

    Notes
    -----

    Problem status being ``coniclifts.SOLVED`` does not mean that the decision variables have
    been assigned specific values. It only means that the solver returned a normal status code
    (i.e. that the solver didn't run into numerical difficulties). If a solver indicates the
    problem is infeasible or unbounded, we still set ``self.status = coniclifts.SOLVED``.
    Therefore it is important to check that ``self.status == coniclifts.SOLVED`` and that
    ``-np.inf < self.value < np.inf`` before accessing a Variable's value.

    Accepts a keyword argument ``integer_variables``: a list of Variable objects which should
    be restricted to integer values in this optimization problem. Only applicable when using
    MOSEK as the solver.

        ----------

        -------
        status : str

            Either ``coniclifts.SOLVED`` or ``coniclifts.INACCURATE`` or ``coniclifts.FAILED``.
            Refer to the Notes of the Problem class for the meanings of these values.

        value : float

            The optimal objective value reported by the solver. Can be a float, ``-np.inf``,
            ``np.inf``, or ``np.NaN``.

        Notes
        -----

        Keyword arguments.

            verbose : bool. If ``False``, then suppress solver output from being written to
            standard-out.

            cache_raw_data : bool. If ``True``, then record the raw output of the solver in
            the dictionary ``self.solver_raw_output``. For MOSEK, this raw output includes the
            MOSEK Task object.

            max_iters : int. Maximum number of iterations for ECOS.

            mosek_params : dict. Following CVXPY parameter processing conventions. Also,
            allows options {``'NUM_THREADS'``: int, ``'CO_TOL_NEAR_REL'``: float,
            ``'TOL_PATH'``: float, ``'TOL_STEP_SIZE'``: float, ``'DEACTIVATE_SCALING':`` bool}.
            Refer to the coniclifts MOSEK interface source code for usage of these parameters.

            cache_apply_data : bool. If ``True``, then take the put``(data, inv_data)``
            returned by the coniclifts interface to the given solver and record it in the
            dictionary ``self.solver_apply_data``. This data is rarely relevant for users.

            dualize : bool. Overrides coniclifts automatic dualization procedure when using MOSEK
            Setting ``dualize=True`` forces dualization, and setting ``dualize=False`` prohibits
            dualization. Not applicable when solving mixed-integer problems.
