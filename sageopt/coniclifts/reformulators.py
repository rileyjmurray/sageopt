def separate_cone_constraints(A, b, K, dont_sep=None):
    """
    Given an affine representation {x : A @ x + b \\in K}, construct a direct
    representation {x : \\exists y with  G @ [x,y] + h \\in K1, y \\in K2},
    where ``K1`` consists exclusively of cones types in ``dont_sep``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : scipy.sparse.csc_matrix
        Has ``m`` rows and ``n`` columns.
    b : ndarray
        Of size ``m``.
    K : List[coniclifts.cones.Cone]
        Satisfies ``sum([co.len for co in K]) == m``.
    dont_sep : set of coniclifts.cones.Cone
        Cones that may be retained in the "affine part" of the feasible set's
        direct representation.

    Returns
    -------

    Examples
    --------

    EX1: Suppose the conic system (A,b,K) can be expressed as {x : B @ x == d, G @ x + h >=0, x >=0 }, where G
    is a non-square matrix. Then by calling this function with dont_sep=None, we obtain the conic system
       { [x,y] : A1 @ [x, y] == b0 } \\cap {[x, y] : x >= 0, y >= 0}
    where A1 = [[B, 0], [G, -I]] and b0 = [d, -h]. This conic system is equivalent to (A,b,K) once we
    project onto the x coordinates.

    This case is interesting because it shows that a cone constraint "x >= 0" can be separated from
    from the matrix system, even though "x" appears in th inequality constraint "G @ x + d >= 0".


    EX2: Suppose the conic system (A,b,K) can be expressed as {x : B @ x == d, L <= x <= U }.
    Then by calling this function with dont_sep=None, we obtain the conic system
    { [x,y,z] : A1 @ [x,y,z] == b0 } \\cap {[x,y,z] : y >= 0, z >= 0 }
    where A1 = [[B, 0, 0], [I, -I, 0], [-I, 0, -I]] and b0 = [b, L, -U]. This conic system is equivalent
    to (A,b,K) once we project out the [y,z] components.

    NOTE: here we ended up introducing slack variables for both inequalities in the variable "x", rather
    than writing {[x,w] : B @ x == b + B @ L, U - L - x - w == 0} \\cap {[x,w] : x >= 0, w >= 0 }. This
    Second option is still a valid formulation, but it is not one that this function would generate.


    EX3: Suppose the conic system (A,b,K) can be expressed as  { x : B @ x == d, G @ x <=_{K_prime} h },
    where every entry of G is nonzero, A is not square, and K_prime does not contain the zero cone.
    Then dont_sep={'0'} yields
    { [x, y] : A1 @ [x, y] == b0 } \\cap { [x, y] : y \\in K_{prime} }
    for A1 = [[B, 0], [-G, -I]] and b0 = [d, -h].

    Notes
    -----
    dont_sep=None is equivalent to dont_sep={'0'}.

    Common use-case: Passing dont_sep={'0','+'}. This ensures that any constraints on nonlinear cones
            (i.e. exp, psd, soc, etc...) are stated simply as "x[indices_j] \\in K_j", where
            "indices_{j1}" and "indices_{j2}" are disjoint whenever j1 \neq j2. This is the main
            modeling requirement for MOSEK's standard form.

    Alternative use-case: Passing dont_sep={'+','0','e','S'} for a conic system involving semidefinite
            constraints. This will force all of the "SDP-ness" of the conic system into disjoint slack variables,
            while aspects of the conic system regarding other cones (e.g. second order cones, exponential cones,
            nonnegative orthants, etc...) are left alone.
